            Jazz is a music genre that originated from African American
            communities of New Orleans in the United States during the
            late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emerged in the form
            of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all
            linked by the common bonds of African American and European
            American musical parentage with a performance orientation.
            Jazz spans a period of over a hundred years, encompassing a
            very wide range of music, making it difficult to define.
